# Orbital_YPC
Orbital Project for Team YPC. A simple mobile fitness app.

### Start
1. npm install
2. Request the config.js file for firebase configuration
3. expo start

### Documentation
1. Always use npm (also called the Node Package Manager) when installing dependencies. I have tested it and using both `npm install` and `yarn install` and/or `expo install` at the same time can lead to disastrous results.

### Code standards
1. Always use functional components

### Troubleshooting
1. Make sure to import React from 'react' in every file
